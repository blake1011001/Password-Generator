# Password-Generator

## Description 
Using javaScript I had to create a random password generator. The prompt gives you a few different options to choose from like the lenght of the password, and also if you'd like to include lowercase, uppercase, numeric, or special characters. After you answer the prompts it will generate your desired password.

## Tasks Completed 
* When you click the button you're presented with a series of prompts for password criteria.
* Can select at least 8 characters and no more than 128.
* Can select the certain criterias you want to include.
* User can mix/match the different criterias for different outcomes.
* Will display your password on the page after you choose the desired prompts.
